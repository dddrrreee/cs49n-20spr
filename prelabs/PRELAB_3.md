# Lab 3 - Hall effect sensor - Prep Worksheet
### Background Summary

We've made LEDs blink according to our code, but what if you want to build a system responds to external input? After reading the lab description, make sure to double check the Broadcom document for how to read GPIO input values from the R/Pi.

### Review Exercises

1) You decide you want to blink an LED connected to pin 12
on the R/Pi. What values do you write to what registers to
accomplish one blink (on + off)?

2) Go over the Broadcom document again. What register will
we use to READ values from the gpio pins? Are there any
other registers relevant to preparing the pin to receive input
from an external source. Give the hexadecimal (0x01234567) address.
