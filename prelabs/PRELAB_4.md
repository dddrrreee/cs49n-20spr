# Lab 4 - Sonar - Prep Worksheet
### Background Summary



### Review Exercises

1) In this lab, you've been asked to implement three functions. Look at each one. Can you figure out what each is supposed to do?

2) For GPIO pins, what is a pulldown/pullup? What does "setting" a pin as pulldown or pullup achieve? If you don't know, do some research online - as mentioned before, a lot of this class is driven by you and your ability to figure out how to use stuff based off of online data sheets.

3) Find the datasheet online for the HC-SR04 sonar device. How long is the pulse to signal the sonar device to send a ranging pulse?
