# Lab 0 - Blink - Prep Worksheet
### Background Summary

As mentioned in the README, this lab will focus on getting you comfortable with the physical R/Pi as well as the development process. You will write very little code for this lab, and instead work through a typical debugging process when working with a combination of hardware and software. At the end, you should be able to run the blink code we've given you on the R/Pi, and be comfortable moving any new code for future labs onto the Pi.

### Lab skills

  1. You will learn how to use the R/Pi dev toolchain.

  2. You will learn how to do differential debugging to find bugs.

  3. You will practice the unix terminal/git skills required for this class.

### Review Exercises

#### Git

1) Git will be used extensively in this class. You may or may not have it installed at this point, so if unsure follow the instructions on installing git in NOTES.md

2) To prepare for the first lab, clone the git repository. For instructions on how to do this, see NOTES.md. 

#### Unix Review

2) What file do you modify to edit your $PATH?
