# Lab 0 - Blink - Prep Worksheet
### Background Summary

A register is a block of memory (often 32 bits long). In the R/Pi, there are quite a few registers dedicated to hardware control. For this lab you will read pgs. ---- of the Broadcom document and look for registers associated with switching the output of the gpio pins on the R/Pi. 

For unix bash terminal users, a .bashrc file is used to set environment variables and customize your terminal.

SD Cards: For Mac Users, SD cards and other mounted volumes can be found in the /Volumes/ directory.

Note: this lab includes a lot of steps and will probably involve installing different tools. Make sure to read the lab readme carefully to figure out what you have to do.

### Lab skills

For this lab, you should be comfortable with a unix terminal, git, and the basics of GPIO / wiring an LED. If possible, experience with binary logical operations and an understanding of computer memory will also be useful.



### Review Exercises

#### Git

Make sure git is installed on your computer. For more information, see the readme.

#### Binary Translations!

2) What is the decimal number 17 is binary?

#### Logical Operations: BITSHIFTING, AND, OR

3) What is (1011 << 2) in decimal?

4) What is 01101001 & 00111000? Binary is fine.

5) What is 1001 | 1100?

6) What is (01111001 & ~(111 << 4)) | (1 << 5)?
